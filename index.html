            <h1>Moscow</h1>
            <small>Capital of Russia</small>
            <p>
                Moscow, on the Moskva River in western Russia, is the nation’s cosmopolitan capital. In its historic
                core is the Kremlin, a complex that’s home to the president and tsarist treasures in the Armoury.
                Outside its walls is Red Square, Russia's symbolic center. It's home to Lenin’s Mausoleum, the State
                Historical Museum's comprehensive collection and St. Basil’s Cathedral, known for its colorful,
                onion-shaped domes.

        <section id="climate">
            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>
                The climate of Moscow is dominated by westerly winds from the Atlantic. Precipitation is moderate, about
                23 inches (580 mm) a year. Snow is common, beginning usually about mid-November and lasting generally
                until mid-March; the city is well-equipped to keep the streets clear. Winters are long, yet they are
                significantly milder than in similar climatic regions of North America. Southerly airstreams
                occasionally bring days with temperatures above freezing. Conversely, northerly winds from the Arctic
                bring very sharp drops in temperature, often accompanied by clear, brisk weather with low relative
                humidity. Thus, although the January average temperature is 14 °F (−10 °C), there can be considerable
                variation; temperatures have dropped to near −45 °F (−43 °C). Spring is relatively brief, and the
                temperature rises rapidly during late April. Summers are warm, and July, the warmest month, has an
                average temperature in the mid-60s F (about 18 °C); temperatures nearing 100 °F (38 °C) have been
                reached in August. Rainy days are not uncommon, but the summer rainfall often comes in brief, heavy
                downpours and thunderstorms. Autumn, like spring, is short, with rapidly falling temperatures.

                Until the late 1950s there was increasing air pollution in Moscow. Smog was common, often with heavy
                concentrations of sulfur dioxide. A major campaign to control noxious emissions was launched, assisted
                greatly by a changeover from coal to natural gas as the principal fuel. Some factories that had
                contributed to pollution were moved out of the city. Slight improvement in Moscow’s air had been marked,
                but since the 1980s the growing number of motor vehicles and the increase in the number of power
                generators have once again bolstered the concentrations of such exhaust pollutants as carbon monoxide
                and sulfur dioxide in Moscow.

            <h2>The Kremlin of Moscow</h2>

                As throughout its history, the Kremlin remains the heart of the city. It is the symbol of both Russian
                and (for a time) Soviet power and authority, and it has served as the official residence of the
                president of the Russian Federation since 1991. The Kremlin’s crenellated red brick walls and its 20
                towers (19 with spires) were built at the end of the 15th century, when a host of Italian builders
                arrived in Moscow at the invitation of Ivan III (the Great). One of the most important towers, the
                Saviour (Spasskaya) Tower, leading to Red Square, was built in 1491 by Pietro Solario, who designed most
                of the main towers; its belfry was added in 1624–25. The chimes of its clock are broadcast by radio as a
                time signal to the whole country. Also on the Red Square front is the St. Nicholas (Nikolskaya) Tower,
                built originally in 1491 and rebuilt in 1806. The two other principal gate towers—the Trinity
                (Troitskaya) Tower, with a bridge and outer barbican (the Kutafya Tower), and the Borovitskaya
                Tower—rise from the western wall.

                Within the Kremlin walls is one of the most striking and beautiful architectural ensembles in the
                world: a combination of churches and palaces, which are open to the public and are among the city’s
                most popular tourist attractions, and the highest offices of the state, which are surrounded by
                strict security. Around the centrally located Cathedral Square are grouped three magnificent
                cathedrals, superb examples of Russian church architecture at its height in the late 15th and early
                16th centuries. These and the other churches in the Kremlin ceased functioning as places of worship
                after the Russian Revolution of 1917, but services recommenced in most Kremlin churches beginning in
                1990. The Cathedral of the Assumption is the oldest, built of white stone in 1475–79 in the
                Italianate-Byzantine style. Its pure, simple, and beautifully proportioned lines and elegant arches
                are crowned by five golden domes. The Orthodox metropolitans and patriarchs of the 14th to 18th
                centuries are buried there. Across the square is the Cathedral of the Annunciation, built in 1484–89
                by craftsmen from Pskov (though burned in 1547, it was rebuilt in 1562–64). Its cluster of chapels
                is topped by golden roofs and domes. Inside are a number of early 15th-century icons attributed to
                Theophanes the Greek and to Andrey Rublyov, considered by many to be the greatest of all Russian
                icon painters. The third cathedral, dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, was rebuilt in 1505–08;
                in it are buried the princes of Moscow and the tsars of Russia (except Boris Godunov) up to the
                founding of St. Petersburg.
